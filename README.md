# hello-world
repository for test purposes

Hello everyonee, Emir is here. I'm trying to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
In this journey, wherever I checked something about web-dev and coding world my path leads me here, at GitHub.

So I come to check and learn about it more. I hope I will use this site's features, share and grow together.

Thanks for reading this!
